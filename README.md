# Transaction Authorizer

## 📌 Overview
Transaction Authorizer is a C# API that processes banking transactions and checks balance availability for different transaction categories.

### 🔹 Features:
- **Process Transactions:** Validates and categorizes transactions based on MCC and balance.
- **Balance Management:** Ensures transactions are processed only when sufficient funds are available.
- **Category Correction:** Adjusts incorrect MCC codes before processing.

## 💡 Why Use This Approach?
This project uses dependency injection and a clean service layer to separate concerns.

### ✅ **Advantages:**
- **Encapsulation:** The `BalanceService` handles balance operations independently.
- **Testability:** The API structure allows easy unit testing.
- **Extensibility:** The `TransactionCategoryService` makes it simple to add new transaction categories.

## 🛠️ Future Improvements
- **Database Integration:** Store accounts and transactions persistently.
- **Logging & Monitoring:** Add better error handling and logging mechanisms.
- **Security Features:** Implement authentication for transaction requests.

## 🧩 Unit Testing
Unit tests ensure reliable transaction processing. The key test cases include:
1. **Transaction Invalid → Returns `07`**
2. **Transaction Approved (Sufficient Balance) → Returns `00`**
3. **Transaction Declined (Insufficient Balance) → Returns `51`**

Run tests with:
```sh
dotnet test
```
